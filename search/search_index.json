If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Slave Device on the RS485 network, it can only function in Polled mode, rather than Event mode due to the RS485 interface being half-duplex rather than a full duplex. 2-wire RS485 is only half duplex. If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network. This is the limitation with the ViSi-Genie protocol, as there is no way to direct the ViSi-Genie protocol to a specific Slave, and there is no way for Half Duplex RS485 to handle the responses from the slaves. If more than 1:1 is required, another Environment such as ViSi will be required.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Slave Device, which is the typical operation for a 4D display using ViSi-Genie, when selecting the Event options on any given widget/object, \u201cReported Messages\u201d cannot be used. The Host must poll each object on the 4Discovery to gain the required information. 4Discovery cannot just send information when it likes, which is the case of Reported Messages, as the 4Discovery is a Slave and therefore is only allowed to speak when spoken to.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Host Device, the Reported Message option can be used as it can speak out to the bus as required since it is the Master of the RS485 bus. However, it is not possible to request information from Slave devices, such as the value of something, as there are no standard functions available in ViSi-Genie to request data from another device. This mode is typically only useful if the 4Discovery only features controls such as buttons, switches, sliders and knobs, which do not require data to be displayed, and only send data out to the slaves for them to do a specific function. Therefore, it has limited but still applicable applications.</p> <p>Workshop4 PRO has an advanced ViSi-Genie environment with new widgets that allow 4DGL code to be executed by the ViSi-Genie environment when various situations occur, such as button presses, data being received, touchscreen interaction, etc. With Workshop4 PRO, a number of the above limitations are lifted and therefore possible.</p> <p>4D Systems has ViSi-Genie libraries for the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino library has been updated to include support for the 4Discovery, to allow it to communicate as a Slave to an Arduino using RS485 (external hardware is required on the Arduino).

An appropriate Protocol is required such that the Master Device transmits out onto the bus to the slaves, either pinpointing a single Slave device or broadcasting to all Slave devices on the Bus. Based on the Protocol, the Slaves will receive the message and if the message is not intended for them, then discard it. If the message is intended for them then wait for the end of the message and reply accordingly.</p> <p>The 4Discovery is not capable of Auto Direction Control and therefore needs to be either externally controlled by the host (as is the case when the 4Discovery is programmed using the 4D RS485 Programmer), or more commonly the 4Discovery would handle the Direction Control of its RS485 transceiver based on the data received on the RS485, dictated by the Protocol.</p> <p>The PA10 GPIO on the 4Discovery is connected to the Turn Around pin on the RJ45 Jack, and it is also connected to the Transmit/Receive controls of its RS485 transceiver.

For example, if the 4Discovery is a Slave and the PA10 GPIO is Low, then the Host is currently in Transmit mode, and data could be flowing over the RS485 and should therefore be captured and processed. If the PA10 GPIO is High, then the 4Discovery has the opportunity to reply or send information to the Host if required, in response to the previous data received.</p> <p>When multiple devices are on the bus, i.e. more than 1 slave, Designer or ViSi Environments can be used to program the 4Discovery as a Slave.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network. This is the limitation with the ViSi-Genie protocol, as there is no way to direct the ViSi-Genie protocol to a specific Slave, and there is no way for Half Duplex RS485 to handle the responses from the slaves. If more than 1:1 is required, another Environment such as ViSi will be required.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Slave Device, which is the typical operation for a 4D display using ViSi-Genie, when selecting the Event options on any given widget/object, \u201cReported Messages\u201d cannot be used.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Slave Device on the RS485 network, it can only function in Polled mode, rather than Event mode due to the RS485 interface being half-duplex rather than a full duplex. 2-wire RS485 is only half duplex. If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network. This is the limitation with the ViSi-Genie protocol, as there is no way to direct the ViSi-Genie protocol to a specific Slave, and there is no way for Half Duplex RS485 to handle the responses from the slaves. If more than 1:1 is required, another Environment such as ViSi will be required.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Slave Device, which is the typical operation for a 4D display using ViSi-Genie, when selecting the Event options on any given widget/object, \u201cReported Messages\u201d cannot be used. The Host must poll each object on the 4Discovery to gain the required information. 4Discovery cannot just send information when it likes, which is the case of Reported Messages, as the 4Discovery is a Slave and therefore is only allowed to speak when spoken to.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Host Device, the Reported Message option can be used as it can speak out to the bus as required since it is the Master of the RS485 bus. However, it is not possible to request information from Slave devices, such as the value of something, as there are no standard functions available in ViSi-Genie to request data from another device. This mode is typically only useful if the 4Discovery only features controls such as buttons, switches, sliders and knobs, which do not require data to be displayed, and only send data out to the slaves for them to do a specific function. Therefore, it has limited but still applicable applications.</p> <p>Workshop4 PRO has an advanced ViSi-Genie environment with new widgets that allow 4DGL code to be executed by the ViSi-Genie environment when various situations occur, such as button presses, data being received, touchscreen interaction, etc. With Workshop4 PRO, a number of the above limitations are lifted and therefore possible.</p> <p>4D Systems has ViSi-Genie libraries for the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino library has been updated to include support for the 4Discovery, to allow it to communicate as a Slave to an Arduino using RS485 (external hardware is required on the Arduino). It utilises the Turn-Around pin on the 4Discovery to control the Transmit/Receive functionality of the RS485 transceiver. This Turn Around Pin control is required as the ViSi-Genie Protocol is defined already and therefore control of the 4Discoverys Transmit/Receive mode needs to be controlled from the Host, the Arduino. ViSi-Genie can be used with other hosts, however, these are the 2 platforms we have libraries written for.</p>","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_10/#connecting-to-external-hardware","title":"Connecting to External Hardware","text":"<p>The 4Discovery is capable of acting as both an RS485 Host, and an RS485 Slave when appropriate circuitry is present on the devices being interfaced to, and appropriate software is written.

An appropriate Protocol is required such that the Master Device transmits out onto the bus to the slaves, either pinpointing a single Slave device or broadcasting to all Slave devices on the Bus. Based on the Protocol, the Slaves will receive the message and if the message is not intended for them, then discard it.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network.

This method however cannot be used to upgrade the PmmC or Display Driver. This can only be done using the 4D RS485 Programmer. To enable the loading of precompiled programs onto the 4Discovery from the microSD card, an appropriate application needs to be written, this is not possible straight out of the box.</p> <p>Here is a diagram to show the basics of how the 4Discovery interfaces with the 4D RS485 Programmer.</p> <p> </p> Figure 5: Programming the 4Discovery using the 4D RS485 Programmer. <p>The Programmer controls the 4Discovery's Turn Around Pin, allowing the programming software to dictate when the 4Discovery is listening and when it is allowed to reply to programming commands. This same setup can be used for general communications also, where there is one external Master and 4Discovery as a single Slave. It is not possible to have multiple Slaves in this situation, due to the way the Turn Around Pin is interfaced with the 4Discovery to make the 4Discovery programmable over the RJ45 connector using RS485.</p> <p>Programming of the 4Discovery is only possible when the 4Discovery is disconnected from the RS485 network and is connected 1:1 with the 4D 485 Programmer. It is not possible to program it when connected to the network, as the Reset and Turn Around pins are required to program the 4Discovery, and other devices may try to communicate on the bus when programming is occurring, which could cause corruption and the programming to fail. Reset and Turn pins are also TTL level, so the distance these should ideally be transmitted over should be as short as possible. Please refer to 4D 485 Programmer, for more information.</p>","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_2/#termination-resistors","title":"Termination Resistors","text":"<p>On each 4Discovery is a built-in 120\u03a9 termination resistor. This is open/deactivated by default.</p> <p>The termination resistor is there to absorb reflections in the RS-485 bus, however typically is only used at each end of the bus, i.e. the first device and the last device. Depending on how you are configuring your system with the 4Discovery, will determine if you need a termination resistor or not. In several cases, having a termination resistor present is better than not having a termination resistor at all, even if the termination is not located at the end of the bus, however, this is very subjective and system-dependent.</p> <p>If the lack of on-board termination is causing problems with communication, it can be enabled but requires the 4Discovery case to be carefully opened and the PCB modified. On the back of the 4Discovery is a cover, which is attached with multiple clips, and can be tricky to remove. Using a plastic tool or possibly two plastic tools, these clips can be carefully opened, and the back cover removed, exposing the circuitry inside.</p> <p></p> <p>Under the cover, towards the bottom, are two sets of pads with the label JP1. These two pads need to have a solder blob added to connect them. This will enable the 120\u03a9 resistor. If the 120\u03a9 resistor needs to be disabled again, these pads can be unsoldered.</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>Extreme care needs to be taken when performing this modification, as too much heat or a slip of the soldering iron could result in components/displays or tracks being damaged.

You can use CAT4, CAT5, CAT5e, CAT6 etc. type cables, but all that is required is 8 wires/conductors and these are straight through, not crossed, to allow correct connection between the two RJ45 plugs/connectors on the 4Discovery and the 4D 485 Programmer. The speed rating of Ethernet cables is not relevant for the 4Discovery since it uses RS485 which operates at a much slower speed than Ethernet.</p> <p>The maximum length of cable between the 4Discovery and the 4D 485 Programmer, should be kept below 10m. This is due to TTL signals on the RJ45 connector that need to be controlled by the 4D 485 Programmer. Anything longer may be feasible depending on the type of cable used, however, typically longer cables will cause voltage drops and capacitive loading which could cause programming to fail.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The 4Discovery cannot be programmed when connected to the RS485 network.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Slave Device on the RS485 network, it can only function in Polled mode, rather than Event mode due to the RS485 interface being half-duplex rather than a full duplex. 2-wire RS485 is only half duplex. If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network. This is the limitation with the ViSi-Genie protocol, as there is no way to direct the ViSi-Genie protocol to a specific Slave, and there is no way for Half Duplex RS485 to handle the responses from the slaves. If more than 1:1 is required, another Environment such as ViSi will be required.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Slave Device, which is the typical operation for a 4D display using ViSi-Genie, when selecting the Event options on any given widget/object, \u201cReported Messages\u201d cannot be used. The Host must poll each object on the 4Discovery to gain the required information. 4Discovery cannot just send information when it likes, which is the case of Reported Messages, as the 4Discovery is a Slave and therefore is only allowed to speak when spoken to.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Host Device, the Reported Message option can be used as it can speak out to the bus as required since it is the Master of the RS485 bus. However, it is not possible to request information from Slave devices, such as the value of something, as there are no standard functions available in ViSi-Genie to request data from another device. This mode is typically only useful if the 4Discovery only features controls such as buttons, switches, sliders and knobs, which do not require data to be displayed, and only send data out to the slaves for them to do a specific function. Therefore, it has limited but still applicable applications.</p> <p>Workshop4 PRO has an advanced ViSi-Genie environment with new widgets that allow 4DGL code to be executed by the ViSi-Genie environment when various situations occur, such as button presses, data being received, touchscreen interaction, etc. With Workshop4 PRO, a number of the above limitations are lifted and therefore possible.</p> <p>4D Systems has ViSi-Genie libraries for the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino library has been updated to include support for the 4Discovery, to allow it to communicate as a Slave to an Arduino using RS485 (external hardware is required on the Arduino). It utilises the Turn-Around pin on the 4Discovery to control the Transmit/Receive functionality of the RS485 transceiver. This Turn Around Pin control is required as the ViSi-Genie Protocol is defined already and therefore control of the 4Discoverys Transmit/Receive mode needs to be controlled from the Host, the Arduino.

If the PA10 GPIO is High, then the 4Discovery has the opportunity to reply or send information to the Host if required, in response to the previous data received.</p> <p>When multiple devices are on the bus, i.e. more than 1 slave, Designer or ViSi Environments can be used to program the 4Discovery as a Slave. If only a single slave exists and no more are going to be added, ViSi-Genie can be used. Please refer to ViSi-Genie Limitations with 4Discovery for more information.</p> <p> </p>    Figure 3: This shows a situation where there are 1 or more Slaves on the network, of which 1 or more could be a 4Discovery.  <p>Each Slave needs to handle the changing of its own Transmit/Receive, based on the information received from the Master.

While this is not a typical situation in the eyes of RS485, it is possible to do so if each of the devices on the RS485 can be programmed to handle this. The protocol programmed into the devices needs to be written such that all devices are in Receiving Mode by default, and only go into Transmit Mode when they are initiating a transmission.

This same setup can be used for general communications also, where there is one external Master and 4Discovery as a single Slave. It is not possible to have multiple Slaves in this situation, due to the way the Turn Around Pin is interfaced with the 4Discovery to make the 4Discovery programmable over the RJ45 connector using RS485.</p> <p>Programming of the 4Discovery is only possible when the 4Discovery is disconnected from the RS485 network and is connected 1:1 with the 4D 485 Programmer.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Slave Device on the RS485 network, it can only function in Polled mode, rather than Event mode due to the RS485 interface being half-duplex rather than a full duplex. 2-wire RS485 is only half duplex. If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network. This is the limitation with the ViSi-Genie protocol, as there is no way to direct the ViSi-Genie protocol to a specific Slave, and there is no way for Half Duplex RS485 to handle the responses from the slaves. If more than 1:1 is required, another Environment such as ViSi will be required.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Slave Device, which is the typical operation for a 4D display using ViSi-Genie, when selecting the Event options on any given widget/object, \u201cReported Messages\u201d cannot be used. The Host must poll each object on the 4Discovery to gain the required information. 4Discovery cannot just send information when it likes, which is the case of Reported Messages, as the 4Discovery is a Slave and therefore is only allowed to speak when spoken to.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Host Device, the Reported Message option can be used as it can speak out to the bus as required since it is the Master of the RS485 bus. However, it is not possible to request information from Slave devices, such as the value of something, as there are no standard functions available in ViSi-Genie to request data from another device. This mode is typically only useful if the 4Discovery only features controls such as buttons, switches, sliders and knobs, which do not require data to be displayed, and only send data out to the slaves for them to do a specific function.

The Arduino library has been updated to include support for the 4Discovery, to allow it to communicate as a Slave to an Arduino using RS485 (external hardware is required on the Arduino). It utilises the Turn-Around pin on the 4Discovery to control the Transmit/Receive functionality of the RS485 transceiver. This Turn Around Pin control is required as the ViSi-Genie Protocol is defined already and therefore control of the 4Discoverys Transmit/Receive mode needs to be controlled from the Host, the Arduino.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network. This is the limitation with the ViSi-Genie protocol, as there is no way to direct the ViSi-Genie protocol to a specific Slave, and there is no way for Half Duplex RS485 to handle the responses from the slaves. If more than 1:1 is required, another Environment such as ViSi will be required.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Slave Device, which is the typical operation for a 4D display using ViSi-Genie, when selecting the Event options on any given widget/object, \u201cReported Messages\u201d cannot be used.

However, it is not possible to request information from Slave devices, such as the value of something, as there are no standard functions available in ViSi-Genie to request data from another device. This mode is typically only useful if the 4Discovery only features controls such as buttons, switches, sliders and knobs, which do not require data to be displayed, and only send data out to the slaves for them to do a specific function.

An appropriate Protocol is required such that the Master Device transmits out onto the bus to the slaves, either pinpointing a single Slave device or broadcasting to all Slave devices on the Bus. Based on the Protocol, the Slaves will receive the message and if the message is not intended for them, then discard it. If the message is intended for them then wait for the end of the message and reply accordingly.</p> <p>The 4Discovery is not capable of Auto Direction Control and therefore needs to be either externally controlled by the host (as is the case when the 4Discovery is programmed using the 4D RS485 Programmer), or more commonly the 4Discovery would handle the Direction Control of its RS485 transceiver based on the data received on the RS485, dictated by the Protocol.</p> <p>The PA10 GPIO on the 4Discovery is connected to the Turn Around pin on the RJ45 Jack, and it is also connected to the Transmit/Receive controls of its RS485 transceiver.

For example, if the 4Discovery is a Slave and the PA10 GPIO is Low, then the Host is currently in Transmit mode, and data could be flowing over the RS485 and should therefore be captured and processed. If the PA10 GPIO is High, then the 4Discovery has the opportunity to reply or send information to the Host if required, in response to the previous data received.</p> <p>When multiple devices are on the bus, i.e. more than 1 slave, Designer or ViSi Environments can be used to program the 4Discovery as a Slave. If only a single slave exists and no more are going to be added, ViSi-Genie can be used. Please refer to ViSi-Genie Limitations with 4Discovery for more information.</p> <p> </p>    Figure 3: This shows a situation where there are 1 or more Slaves on the network, of which 1 or more could be a 4Discovery.  <p>Each Slave needs to handle the changing of its own Transmit/Receive, based on the information received from the Master.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Slave Device on the RS485 network, it can only function in Polled mode, rather than Event mode due to the RS485 interface being half-duplex rather than a full duplex. 2-wire RS485 is only half duplex. If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network. This is the limitation with the ViSi-Genie protocol, as there is no way to direct the ViSi-Genie protocol to a specific Slave, and there is no way for Half Duplex RS485 to handle the responses from the slaves. If more than 1:1 is required, another Environment such as ViSi will be required.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Slave Device, which is the typical operation for a 4D display using ViSi-Genie, when selecting the Event options on any given widget/object, \u201cReported Messages\u201d cannot be used. The Host must poll each object on the 4Discovery to gain the required information. 4Discovery cannot just send information when it likes, which is the case of Reported Messages, as the 4Discovery is a Slave and therefore is only allowed to speak when spoken to.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Host Device, the Reported Message option can be used as it can speak out to the bus as required since it is the Master of the RS485 bus. However, it is not possible to request information from Slave devices, such as the value of something, as there are no standard functions available in ViSi-Genie to request data from another device.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Slave Device on the RS485 network, it can only function in Polled mode, rather than Event mode due to the RS485 interface being half-duplex rather than a full duplex. 2-wire RS485 is only half duplex. If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network. This is the limitation with the ViSi-Genie protocol, as there is no way to direct the ViSi-Genie protocol to a specific Slave, and there is no way for Half Duplex RS485 to handle the responses from the slaves. If more than 1:1 is required, another Environment such as ViSi will be required.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Slave Device, which is the typical operation for a 4D display using ViSi-Genie, when selecting the Event options on any given widget/object, \u201cReported Messages\u201d cannot be used. The Host must poll each object on the 4Discovery to gain the required information. 4Discovery cannot just send information when it likes, which is the case of Reported Messages, as the 4Discovery is a Slave and therefore is only allowed to speak when spoken to.</p> <p>If the basic ViSi-Genie is to be used when operating as a Host Device, the Reported Message option can be used as it can speak out to the bus as required since it is the Master of the RS485 bus. However, it is not possible to request information from Slave devices, such as the value of something, as there are no standard functions available in ViSi-Genie to request data from another device. This mode is typically only useful if the 4Discovery only features controls such as buttons, switches, sliders and knobs, which do not require data to be displayed, and only send data out to the slaves for them to do a specific function. Therefore, it has limited but still applicable applications.</p> <p>Workshop4 PRO has an advanced ViSi-Genie environment with new widgets that allow 4DGL code to be executed by the ViSi-Genie environment when various situations occur, such as button presses, data being received, touchscreen interaction, etc. With Workshop4 PRO, a number of the above limitations are lifted and therefore possible.</p> <p>4D Systems has ViSi-Genie libraries for the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino library has been updated to include support for the 4Discovery, to allow it to communicate as a Slave to an Arduino using RS485 (external hardware is required on the Arduino). It utilises the Turn-Around pin on the 4Discovery to control the Transmit/Receive functionality of the RS485 transceiver. This Turn Around Pin control is required as the ViSi-Genie Protocol is defined already and therefore control of the 4Discoverys Transmit/Receive mode needs to be controlled from the Host, the Arduino. ViSi-Genie can be used with other hosts, however, these are the 2 platforms we have libraries written for.</p>","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_8/#connecting-to-external-hardware","title":"Connecting to External Hardware","text":"<p>The 4Discovery is capable of acting as both an RS485 Host, and an RS485 Slave when appropriate circuitry is present on the devices being interfaced to, and appropriate software is written.

An appropriate Protocol is required such that the Master Device transmits out onto the bus to the slaves, either pinpointing a single Slave device or broadcasting to all Slave devices on the Bus. Based on the Protocol, the Slaves will receive the message and if the message is not intended for them, then discard it.

If the PA10 GPIO is High, then the 4Discovery has the opportunity to reply or send information to the Host if required, in response to the previous data received.</p> <p>When multiple devices are on the bus, i.e. more than 1 slave, Designer or ViSi Environments can be used to program the 4Discovery as a Slave.

If the 4Discovery is being programmed as a Master Device (Host) on the RS485 network, it can operate using Event mode, however, is limited in data that can be returned from the slaves.</p> <p>When the 4Discovery is used with the basic ViSi-Genie, only a single Master/Host and a single Slave can be present on the network.

This method however cannot be used to upgrade the PmmC or Display Driver. This can only be done using the 4D RS485 Programmer. To enable the loading of precompiled programs onto the 4Discovery from the microSD card, an appropriate application needs to be written, this is not possible straight out of the box.</p> <p>Here is a diagram to show the basics of how the 4Discovery interfaces with the 4D RS485 Programmer.</p> <p> </p> Figure 5: Programming the 4Discovery using the 4D RS485 Programmer. <p>The Programmer controls the 4Discovery's Turn Around Pin, allowing the programming software to dictate when the 4Discovery is listening and when it is allowed to reply to programming commands. This same setup can be used for general communications also, where there is one external Master and 4Discovery as a single Slave. It is not possible to have multiple Slaves in this situation, due to the way the Turn Around Pin is interfaced with the 4Discovery to make the 4Discovery programmable over the RJ45 connector using RS485.</p> <p>Programming of the 4Discovery is only possible when the 4Discovery is disconnected from the RS485 network and is connected 1:1 with the 4D 485 Programmer. It is not possible to program it when connected to the network, as the Reset and Turn Around pins are required to program the 4Discovery, and other devices may try to communicate on the bus when programming is occurring, which could cause corruption and the programming to fail. Reset and Turn pins are also TTL level, so the distance these should ideally be transmitted over should be as short as possible. Please refer to 4D 485 Programmer, for more information.</p>","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_9/#termination-resistors","title":"Termination Resistors","text":"<p>On each 4Discovery is a built-in 120\u03a9 termination resistor. This is open/deactivated by default.</p> <p>The termination resistor is there to absorb reflections in the RS-485 bus, however typically is only used at each end of the bus, i.e. the first device and the last device. Depending on how you are configuring your system with the 4Discovery, will determine if you need a termination resistor or not. In several cases, having a termination resistor present is better than not having a termination resistor at all, even if the termination is not located at the end of the bus, however, this is very subjective and system-dependent.</p> <p>If the lack of on-board termination is causing problems with communication, it can be enabled but requires the 4Discovery case to be carefully opened and the PCB modified. On the back of the 4Discovery is a cover, which is attached with multiple clips, and can be tricky to remove. Using a plastic tool or possibly two plastic tools, these clips can be carefully opened, and the back cover removed, exposing the circuitry inside.</p> <p></p> <p>Under the cover, towards the bottom, are two sets of pads with the label JP1. These two pads need to have a solder blob added to connect them. This will enable the 120\u03a9 resistor. If the 120\u03a9 resistor needs to be disabled again, these pads can be unsoldered.</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>Extreme care needs to be taken when performing this modification, as too much heat or a slip of the soldering iron could result in components/displays or tracks being damaged. This should only be attempted by people who know the risks and are capable of modifying the PCB.</p>","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_9/#mechanical-details","title":"Mechanical Details","text":"","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_9/#schematic-details-hw-rev-27","title":"Schematic Details - HW REV 2.7","text":"","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_9/#schematic-details-hw-rev-40","title":"Schematic Details - HW REV 4.0","text":"","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_9/#schematic-details-hw-rev-42","title":"Schematic Details - HW REV 4.2","text":"","tags":["Diablo16"]},{"location":"doc_9/#specifications","title":"Specifications","text":"<p>Absolute Maximum Ratings</p> Operating ambient temperature -20\u00b0C to +70\u00b0C Storage temperature -30\u00b0C to +80\u00b0C Voltage on VCC with respect to GND 7.0V to 30VDC Voltage on 5V_IN with respect to GND 4.5V to 5.5V <p>Note</p> <p>Stresses above those listed here may cause permanent damage to the device.
